# Gale Healthcare Code Challenge

## **[Live Preview](https://obsessive-coder.github.io/gale-healthcare-client/)**

### **[Backend Project](https://github.com/Obsessive-Coder/gale-healthcare-backend)**

This is the client application for a fullstack website that uses React, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, JS, and MYSQL to show the solutions to the code challenge questions. The projects are deployed on Github Pages, Heroku, and AWS RDS.

With the live preview loaded in a browser you can expand each question. After clicking the 'solve' button, the client sends a request to the server hosted on Heroku which. The server and API run the correct solution file and returns the answer for the question. For Question 2, the solution code connects to an AWS RDS database to retrieve data and perform its operations. You can click the button labeled 'Show Code' to see the code for the question's solution.

## Solution Files
All solutions are coded in their required language, however, the project uses a php solution to return the solution for Question 6 when the challenge clearly stated to use JavaScript. I have the solution coded in JS as well and this file is in the same directory as the rest of the solutions.
